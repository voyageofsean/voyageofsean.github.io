Abstract: Link trustworthiness evaluation is a crucial task for information networks to evaluate the probability of a link being true in a heterogeneous information network (HIN). This task can significantly influence the effectiveness of downstream analysis. However, the performance of existing evaluation methods is limited, as they can only utilize incomplete or one-sided information from a single HIN. To address this problem, we propose a novel multi-HIN link trustworthiness evaluation model that leverages information across multiple related HINs to accomplish link trustworthiness evaluation tasks inherently and efficiently. We present an effective method to evaluate and select informative pairs across HINs and an integrated training procedure to balance inner-HIN and inter-HIN trustworthiness. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms baseline methods and achieves the best accuracy and F1-score in downstream tasks of HINs.
