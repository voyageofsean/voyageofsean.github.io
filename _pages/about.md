I major in AI. My research interest is deep learning for graphs and NLP. 

Currently, I am working on neuro-symbolic systems for question answering, i.e., integrating symbolic reasoning into neural QA systems.

Personal interest
---
- TRPG. I enjoy playing Call of Cthulhu TRPG with my colleagues. Also, I love CRPGs that involves TRPG elements, such as [Disco Elysium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_Elysium) and the [Divinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinity_(series)) series.

- Philosophy. I prefer reflecting on ideologies, ontologies and values. Currently I am studying [Physoanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis) and [Semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics).
