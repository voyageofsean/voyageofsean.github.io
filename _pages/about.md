This is Chunshu Li.

I am currently working on a Master's program on Machine Learning at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing. I am supervised by Professor [Min-Ling Zhang](http://palm.seu.edu.cn/zhangml/). I am also a member of the [PALM](http://palm.seu.edu.cn/) Lab.

Previously I was working with [Beilun Wang](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2019/0105/c23024a257533/page.htm) and [Meng Wang](http://seu.wangmengsd.com/) on graph mining and knowledge graph.

I primarily study machine learning and data mining. I have previously worked on graph neural networks, information retrieval, recommendation systems, and natural language processing.
