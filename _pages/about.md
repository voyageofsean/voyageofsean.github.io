This is Chunshu Li.

I am currently working on a Master's program on Artificial Intelligence at [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), Nanjing. I am supervised by Professor [Min-Ling Zhang](http://palm.seu.edu.cn/zhangml/) and [Tong Wei](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/weit/). I am also a member of the [PALM](http://palm.seu.edu.cn/) Lab.

Previously I was working with [Beilun Wang](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2019/0105/c23024a257533/page.htm) and [Meng Wang](http://seu.wangmengsd.com/) on graph mining and NLP.
